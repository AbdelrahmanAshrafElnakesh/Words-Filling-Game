            <h2>Earth</h2>
            <p>The term Earth relates to the entire planet and the SDGs focus on ensuring a sustainable future for all. It is at the core of the SDGs, particularly through Goal 13: Climate Action. This goal emphasizes urgent measures to combat climate change and its impacts on Earth. Other relevant goals include Goal 14: Life Below Water (protection of oceans) and Goal 15: Life on Land (conserving terrestrial ecosystems).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col clean">
            <h2>Clean</h2>
            <p>Clean refers to the idea of maintaining purity in our surroundings, particularly in water, air, and environment. This concept is captured in multiple SDGs:

              Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation (ensuring availability and sustainable management of clean water)
              Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities (promoting sustainable urban development)
              Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production (reducing waste and promoting recycling).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col grass">
            <h2>Grass</h2>
            <p>Grass symbolizes nature, ecosystems, and biodiversity. It connects to Goal 15: Life on Land, which focuses on managing forests sustainably, combatting desertification, and halting biodiversity loss. Grass also represents the importance of maintaining green spaces for ecological balance, critical for climate resilience and human well-being.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col peace">
            <h2>Peace</h2>
            <p>Peace aligns with Goal 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions, which focuses on promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, ensuring access to justice, and building effective institutions. Peaceful societies are foundational for sustainable development, as conflicts and injustice can hinder environmental and social progress.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col green1">
            <h2>Green</h2>
            <p>Green is associated with environmental sustainability, ecosystems, and promoting renewable energy. This concept touches many SDGs:

              Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy (promoting renewable energy solutions)
              Goal 13: Climate Action (fighting climate change)
              Goal 15: Life on Land (protecting ecosystems, forests, and biodiversity).
